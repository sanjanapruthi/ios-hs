Projects I created for iOS in high school.

**Note - these projects need Xcode to run. **

### Birthday Reminder

This app serves as a way to remember the birthdays of all your contacts. You can either manually input your contacts, or have the app import your contacts' data. I used permissions in order to enable the app to access a user's contacts. Once the app has contacts to display, it will display them in a table view. On any given contact's birthday, the app will send you a notification that it is that person's birthday, ensuring that you never forget a birthday again!

To run, open "Birthday Reminder 2.xcodeproj"


### Shopping Calculator 

This app is similar to a regular calculator, but it is specifically designed for shopping. It has additional buttons that allow you to input the tax and any sales on an item, and it will then calculate the total price of the item as well as whether it is over or under your budget. 

To run, open "ShoppingCalculator.xcodeproj"

Note - this app runs best on an iPhone 7 simulator.
